    <p>My name is Kayla, and I'm a biomedical engineering major. I think that the engineering design process is so interesting and using it
	and my passion for human biology to help people is the best of both worlds. My entire family is full of engineers and seeing how their
	minds work and their throught processes take them through a problem is really amazing and I want to do that when I grow up. 
	I love working with people and coming up with ways to help them feel better and doing biomedical engineering combines everything that I love.

	<p>I am currently a YMCA afterschool counselor. I started working for the Y at a special needs summer camp in 2016 and haven't stopped.
	I love the work that I do and I am good at it. I have been promoted to office manager and have a lot of different specialties. I have 
	worked with age groups ranging from 3 weeks old to 14 years old even though my favorite is either the little babies or kindergardeners and 
	first grade. I have to quit this fall though because of school; however, I really don't want to.
