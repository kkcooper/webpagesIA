	My name is Kayla, and I'm a <strong>biomedical engineering</strong> major. I think that the engineering design process is so interesting and using it
	and my passion for human biology to help people is the best of both worlds. My <underline>entire</underline> family is full of engineers and seeing how their
	minds work and their throught processes take them through a problem is really amazing and I want to do that when I grow up. 
	I love working with people and coming up with ways to help them feel better and doing biomedical engineering combines everything that I love.

	I am currently a <italic>YMCA afterschool counselor</italic>. I started working for the Y at a special needs summer camp in 2016 and haven't stopped.
	I love the work that I do and I am good at it. I have been promoted to office manager and have a lot of different specialties. I have 
	worked with age groups ranging from 3 weeks old to 14 years old even though my favorite is either the little babies or kindergardeners and 
	first grade. I have to quit this fall though because of school; however, I really don't want to.
